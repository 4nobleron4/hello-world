# hello-world
New and eager to learn.
Not completly wet behind the ears, started rooting and modding Android around 2012. Life changes have found me with a lot of extra time to deal with so I decided 7 years was long enough to figure out this Github thing-a-ma-bobber and todays the day I joined. I enjoy coffee, cannabis, Linux and Android among other things.
